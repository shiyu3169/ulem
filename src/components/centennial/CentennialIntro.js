            THE URBAN LEAGUE OF EASTERN MA IS CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF SERVING
            METROPOLITIAN BOSTON
          </h3>
          <p>
            One hundred years ago, local business and civic leaders of diverse
            backgrounds and ethnicity created what was known as the Boston Urban
            League. In 1919, the League brought together people that were doing
            similar work to share in one large appeal to help people move from
            dependency to self-sufficiency. While our role in the community has
            not changed throughout the years, we continue to bring together the
            resources to thousands of people and families seeking to live out
            the American Dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
            This historic centennial offers an unparalleled opportunity to
            commemorate a milestone of the civil rights movement and to explore
            its relevance to the issues of diversity and inclusion today.
