        <p>
          The history of the Boston Urban League now known as the Urban League
          of Eastern Massachusetts from 1919 to 2019 with excerpts from our
          historical archives, newspaper articles, surveys, and Urban League
          reports:
        </p>
        <p>
          The opening phrase used throughout our history at the local and
          national level was the same; “Not Alms, But Opportunity.” This phrase
          summarizes our philosophy and attitude towards what we wanted, as
          citizens, in this society and how desperately we were willing to work
          hard for it and strive for its achievement and fulfillment. During our
          20th anniversary report in 1939, those efforts painted a world picture
          of 20 years on the inter-racial activity in Boston by a group of
          forward-thinking white and colored citizens. The Boston Urban League
          celebrated 20 years of service with a deep consciousness of the many
          aims and ideas that have not been attained, yet it holds its faith in
          the efficacy of inter-racial cooperation as the key to this most
          perplexing race problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the first Annual report, Matthew W. Bullock had the following to
          say: “Though Negroes have been living in and around Boston since 1632,
          there is probably no large city in the country where they find it so
          difficult to secure employment that will pay a living wage.” This
          statement was true in 1939, and it still resonates with repercussions
          in 2019. The lack of meaningful diversity and inclusion in various
          industries such as IT, Bio-Tech, Hospitality, Health Care, Higher
          education persist. We are still at a woefully lacking level of
          representation on the corporate board of directors, newsrooms,
          philanthropic circles, and real estate development teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Have we made progress in this country? Yes. Things are somewhat more
          covert rather than terrorizing overt acts. However, these changes have
          not been at lightning speed. It has been a painstakingly stubborn
          fight to create a level playing field.
        </p>
        <p>
          In spite of these notable realities, however, there have been many
          corporate partners, individual donors, foundation officers, federal,
          state, and local supporters who have vigilantly worked with us over
          the years to combat these ongoing challenges. They are very much a
          vital and critical part of this historical journey. We are what we
          have become because of your progressive input and support. Just as
          crucial to this acknowledgment, is the time, talent, and treasures of
          the Board of Directors, the staff of the League, the Urban League
          Guild members and the Urban League Young Professionals Network. When I
          reflect on the overall contributions that all of you have made over
          these 100 years none of our accomplishments would have been made
          possible, without you.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this centennial milestone, our work is not without hope,
          inspiration, and encouragement. Our presence in Boston has made a
          significant difference. We see firsthand the impact on individuals and
          their families. Their testimonies reinforce our need to stay in the
          struggle and keep our focus and maintain our determination. As a
          strong Affiliate, it does not matter the kind of problem or challenges
          we face or the difficulties presented or the pain that accompanies the
          specifics when they come thru the door. We know deep down something
          has to be done. We can, and we must do better because we are the last
          stop on this railroad of change.
        </p>
        <p>
          For ten decades, this is what we have collectively done. So we will
          continue to do this work until there is no need for dealing with
          racial injustice, lack of employment opportunities and persistent
          economic disparities. When that parity happens America, we will truly
          live up to the Constitutional promises with the boldness of a true
          bi-racial democracy.{" "}
