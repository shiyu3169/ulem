            A Message from President/CEO
          </h2>
          <p>
            The history of the Boston Urban League now known as the Urban League
            of Eastern Massachusetts from 1919 to 2019 with excerpts from our
            historical archives, newspaper articles, surveys, and Urban League
            reports:
          </p>
          <p>
            The opening phrase used throughout our history at the local and
            national level was the same; “Not Alms, But Opportunity.” This
            phrase summarizes our philosophy and attitude towards what we
            wanted, as citizens, in this society and how desperately we were
            willing to work hard for it and strive for its achievement and
            fulfillment. During our 20th anniversary report in 1939, those
            efforts painted a world picture of 20 years on the inter-racial
            activity in Boston by a group of forward-thinking white and colored
            citizens. The Boston Urban League celebrated 20 years of service
            with a deep consciousness of the many aims and ideas that have not
            been attained, yet it holds its faith in the efficacy of
            inter-racial cooperation as the key to this most perplexing race
            problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the first Annual report, Matthew W. Bullock had the following to
            say: “Though Negroes have been living in and around Boston since
            1632, there is probably no large city in the country where they find
            it so difficult to secure employment that will pay a living wage.”
            This statement was true in 1939, and it still resonates with
            repercussions in 2019. The lack of meaningful diversity and
            inclusion in various industries such as IT, Bio-Tech, Hospitality,
            Health Care, Higher education persist. We are still at a woefully
            lacking level of representation on the corporate board of directors,
            newsrooms, philanthropic circles, and real estate development teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            Have we made progress in this country? Yes. Things are somewhat more
            covert rather than terrorizing overt acts. However, these changes
            have not been at lightning speed. It has been a painstakingly
            stubborn fight to create a level playing field.
          </p>
          <p>
            In spite of these notable realities, however, there have been many
            corporate partners, individual donors, foundation officers, federal,
            state, and local supporters who have vigilantly worked with us over
            the years to combat these ongoing challenges. They are very much a
            vital and critical part of this historical journey. We are what we
            have become because of your progressive input and support. Just as
            crucial to this acknowledgment, is the time, talent, and treasures
            of the Board of Directors, the staff of the League, the Urban League
            Guild members and the Urban League Young Professionals Network. When
            I reflect on the overall contributions that all of you have made
            over these 100 years none of our accomplishments would have been
            made possible, without you.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this centennial milestone, our work is not without hope,
            inspiration, and encouragement. Our presence in Boston has made a
            significant difference. We see firsthand the impact on individuals
            and their families. Their testimonies reinforce our need to stay in
            the struggle and keep our focus and maintain our determination. As a
            strong Affiliate, it does not matter the kind of problem or
            challenges we face or the difficulties presented or the pain that
            accompanies the specifics when they come thru the door. We know deep
            down something has to be done. We can, and we must do better because
            we are the last stop on this railroad of change.
          </p>
          <p>
            For ten decades, this is what we have collectively done. So we will
            continue to do this work until there is no need for dealing with
            racial injustice, lack of employment opportunities and persistent
            economic disparities. When that parity happens America, we will
            truly live up to the Constitutional promises with the boldness of a
            true bi-racial democracy.{" "}
