        <p>
          Founded in 1917 and affiliated in 1919, the Urban League of Eastern
          Massachusetts (ULEM) is a 501c3 nonprofit organization and one of the
          oldest affiliates within the National Urban League (can “National
          Urban League” be a link to their webpage:
          http://nul.iamempowered.com/) movement. From the time that our doors
          opened to the at-large Boston community and surrounding metropolitan
          area residents, ULEM has been employing a multi-point strategy to
          deliver services and programs which aim to increase self-reliance,
          specifically in the area of workforce development.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mission of the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts is to be a
          champion of civil rights dedicated to helping people improve their
          lives and to build stronger communities by providing local residents
          with education, job training, and placement at no cost. For nearly 100
          years, ULEM’s programs and services have given hope to our program
          participants and made a lasting, positive impact in the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focusing on this overarching goal leads us to provide opportunities
          for every person that walks through our door to realize economic
          empowerment through basic- and mid-level skills trainings,
          certifications, internships, and job placements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Offering programs and services at no cost to every participant, we
          facilitate an array of skills-training workshops which cover a variety
          of job skills and expertise; serve a wide age range; and engage both
          non-profit organizations and corporate partners. Currently, ULEM
          programs and services include 3 job placement-based programs and 5
          skills development programs. All program participants receive case
          management services, inclusive of domestic/sexual violence victim
          assistance, and placement assistance. ULEM also operates an Employment
          Resource Center, which is available to anyone who is in need of
          computer access for the purposes of attaining employment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The programs and services offered are supported by two annual
          projects: (1) Jobs Rebuild Boston Community Conference and Career Fair
          and (2) the State of Black Boston report. Additional to the
          aforementioned programs, the Urban League of Eastern Massachusetts
          offers two auxiliary groups: the Urban League of Eastern MA Guild and
          the Young Professionals Network of the Urban League of Eastern MA (can
          “Young Professionals Network of the Urban League of Eastern MA” point
          to their website: www.ypnulem.org). Both groups have open membership,
          facilitate events and workshops and serve the community in alignment
          with ULEM’s mission and strategic goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holistically, through the 3 channels, the ULEM – along with its
          auxiliaries: the ULEM Guild and YPN-ULEM – serves thousands of people
          annually.
