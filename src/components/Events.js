          Annually, ULEM honors its mission by hosting 3 signature events, our
          Annual Meeting, Gala, and Jobs Rebuild Boston Community Conference and
          Career Fair.
        </p>
        <h4>Annual Meeting</h4>
        <p>
          ULEM hosts its annual meeting every December to share with the
          community the impact that has been made during the most recent fiscal
          year. During this time, ULEM also celebrates the holiday season with a
          reception post the meeting. If interested in receiving the most recent
          annual report, please send an email to development@ulem.org.
        </p>
        <h4>ULEM Gala</h4>
        <p>
          ULEM’s annual awards gala is, by far, one of the most important events
          that provides unrestricted, financial support for daily operations.
          Specifically, the proceeds from the gala supports our programs and
          overhead expenses, which can only be covered by unrestricted funding.
        </p>
        <p>
          The awards gala is held during the spring, typically in April. It is
          always attended by corporate partners, community leaders, elected
          officials, the community at-large, our auxiliary memberships, and
          staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          Past corporate funders include Eastern Bank, Harvard Pilgrim Health
          Care, State Street Corporation, UPS and several others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Past awardees have been corporate champions, community activists and
          leaders, professional athletes, small business owners, and ULEM board
          members.{" "}
