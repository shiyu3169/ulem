          All of our programs lead towards certifications. Currently, ULEM
          offers the following: Internet and Computing Core Certification;
          Microsoft Office Specialist Certification; and ACT National Career
          Readiness Certification.
        </p>
        <h4>Microsoft Office Specialist Certification (MOS)</h4>
        <p>
          MOS certification demonstrates that the holder has the skills needed
          to proficiently use Microsoft Office. An entry level employee with MOS
          certification positions him- or herself to earn as much as $16,000
          more in annual salary than uncertified peers. All participants have
          the opportunity to get certified in Microsoft Office 2013. The options
          are Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Access, SharePoint, and OneNote.
          ULEM is an authorized testing center.

        <h4>Act National Career Readiness Certification (NCRC)</h4>
        <p>
          NCRC, issued by ACT, is a portable, evidence-based credential that
          measures essential workplace skills and is a reliable predictor of
          workplace success. Knowledge and skills related to job tasks are the
          strongest predictors of work performance. When measures of cognitive
          skills and personality traits are combined, an individual’s success in
          a job or job training can be predicted with even greater accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The certificate is designed to complement other traditional
          credentials, such as a high school diploma, community college degree,
          or college degree. While these education credentials mark the
          fulfillment of an individual’s classroom learning experiences, the
          certificate confirms the person’s competency in a specific set of
          workplace skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          This certification demonstrates to a prospective employer that their
          candidate is competent to perform work-related tasks. This
          certification is offered to all program participants, as well as,
          anyone interested in this credential.
        </p>

          Whether one is looking for a first job or is just ready for a change
          in career, the information that the vast majority of employers are
          looking for can be conveyed through the National Career Readiness
          Certificate. Employers want to know that a prospective employee can
          process written instructions, policies, and procedures (Reading for
          Information), use charts, graphs, and figures to solve workplace
          problems (Locating Information), and utilize math skills to work
          through challenging scenarios in the workplace (Applied Mathematics).
          In an employer’s eyes, these “foundational skills” provide the basis
          for developing an employee who will be an asset to the company.
          Companies usually have no objections to training their employees, but
          they want to make sure that they are investing their training
          resources wisely. In short, they want employees who have proven
          themselves to be trainable. Going through the process of getting
          career certified shows employers that one is serious about career
          ambitions and that s/he is motivated to succeed. It also helps one to
          evaluate his/her own skills and abilities so that s/he can find the
          job that’s a best fit.
